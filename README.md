# About-me
 
 My project is about building a web page using HTML for the structure of the page, CSS for styling the page and JavaScript to add the functionality including using: Let, Switch statement, loops.

The web page itself is talking about myself and mentioning some information about my background such as: Education, Work Experiences and what I do prefer in my personal life like movies or food.

            <p>
                I received my master's degree in August 2015 from University of Jordan in Public Administration
                and received a bachelor's degree in August 2011 from University of Jordan in Political Science. I
                have a working experience in "Open-source Intelligence", my last position was “Senior Media
                Analyst”. I enrolled in Software Development course at ASAC; because I believe this course will help me to achieve my goals and I'm excited about it.
